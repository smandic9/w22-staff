title: Chief Assessment Officer
roleabbr: CAO
description: Helps grade the quiz and its versions.
works-with: CAC, CAO, CLO

* Add rubrics / grade the quizzes (always send the release email when grades are released) 
* Set the regrade window on Gradescope (close on {{ site.quiz_regrade_close }})
* Address regrades - ping the CLO if not sure how to address the request.
    * If giving back points, don't change the original rubric (it's confusing to read the regrade request without seeing the original rubric items) - instead, use the points adjustment (the only time this should be used)
* Works with CAC and CLO to create/update the rubrics, note questions that need to be changed in the future.
