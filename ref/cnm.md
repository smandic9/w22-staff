# How-to for the CNM

Hi! Hope you feel good about your new role and responsibilities because they are 
very cool and highly important! 

First - if you will ever have any doubts - feel free to ask the instructor (CLO) or anyone in the team, you will be surprised how helpful and nice they are. 

Throughout the term, please help us update the notes below by modifying this page on GitHub (use the link at the bottom of this page).
