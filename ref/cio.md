# How-to for the CIO

Hi! Hope you feel good about your new role and responsibilities because they are 
very cool and highly important! 

First - if you will ever have any doubts - feel free to ask the instructor (CLO) or anyone in the team, you will be surprised how helpful and nice they are. 

Throughout the term, please help us update the notes below by modifying this page on GitHub (use the link at the bottom of this page).

## Official Responsibilities
{% assign roles = site.roles | where: 'roleabbr', 'CIO' %}
{% for role in roles %}
{{ role }}
{% endfor %}

### Getting started
Before the start of the quarter, work with the CLO to verify that you:
* have access to previous announcements / know where to find them
* have access to the [weekly review document]({{ site.weekly_review_doc }})

## Notes

* TODO: add the information that you wish we included here :-)

Hope you will have an amazing mentoring semester! Have the best of luck!
